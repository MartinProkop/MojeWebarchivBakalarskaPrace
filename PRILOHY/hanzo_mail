Hello, 

I'm writing a bachelor's thesis dealing with the migration tools of web archive at Masaryk's University in Brno. The thesis is concerned with the possibility of migration of project WEBARCHIVE.CZ (member of IIPC) repository.

During the warctools testing I probably discovered a bug. So I would like report it. 

I'm using your arc2warc.py migration script. The warcvalid.py script reports that some invalid warc files are created during the migration. That depends on the way of running the arc2warc.py tool - either and more often using a parameter "-o" (according to the documentation of warctools.py) or using the redirection of a standard output in shell.

For some of the archives the error occurs in both of the cases. In some cases the validator reports either this [('incorrect trailing newline', '\r')] or [('incorrect trailing newline', '\n')].

According to my knowledge there's a problem with the NEWLINE character coding. It's probably a mistake in the warc.py file.

The used archives have over 100 MB each so I can't send it to you.

I'm using the version of warctools - Tag: 4.3-rc; Revision: 017110fd860a8; Date: 2012-03-02.


Best regards,
Martin Prokop.
