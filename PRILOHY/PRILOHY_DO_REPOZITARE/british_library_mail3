Subject: RE: migration to warc format

Hi Martin, 
Apologies for the delay in responding. Although there was much discussion on the subject
of deduplication at the time, the decision was made not to do so. As I recall, we did an
analysis of the MIME, URL and hash from a CDX index of the entire archive and decided the
saving in space wouldn't warrant the additional processing time. 

Regards, 
Roger

Hello! 

Thank you for the information, that you sent me. I was aleready familiar with most of
it. 

The WARC format should be able to remove the files, that are included in the archiv
repeatedly (the redundant files are removed and their references are set to the one
preserved file). 

Did you make use of this ability, when you carried out the migration? 

Best reagards
