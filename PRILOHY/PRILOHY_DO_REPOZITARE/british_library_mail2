Subject: RE: arc to warc migration

Hello, Martin.
There are a couple of documents which might be worth reviewing.
Apologies if you've already read these or have already considered
anything I jot down. First, the Internet Archive published a page on
migrating (reversibly) between the two formats:
https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/ARC+to+WARC+%28to+ARC%29
We used an earlier version of this page as the starting point for some
of our own considerations on the process. Additionally, there's a fairly
detailed series of guidelines on the creation of WARC files which we
were pointed to recently by the Royal Library of Denmark:
http://netpreserve.org/publications/WARC_Guidelines_v1.pdf
While there's a lot of content there are some useful thoughts on
migration.
We have actually migrated several terabytes of ARC files to WARCs over
the last year. The migration process itself isn't particularly
difficult: ARCs contain a single line of plaintext followed by a content
block and the content block remains untouched between the ARC and WARC;
the only real consideration is mapping the relevant headers. The ARC's
URL, IP, date and content-length have direct equivalents in the
WARC-Target-URI, WARC-IP-Address, WARC-Date and Content-Length. The only
oddity is the MIME type which doesn't directly map to the WARC's
Content-Type. The Content-Type of a WARC record refers to the content
block, not the payload; for the latter there's
WARC-Identified-Payload-Type which can be used to store the ARC's MIME
record. 
Beyond that the only complexities are matters of preservation (i.e.
making sure the HTTP block really does remain untouched) and metadata
(which largely depends on the requirements of your institution). I hope
some of this was useful - please feel free to ask for elaboration on any
point or specific examples of anything. Other than that: good luck!

Subject: arc to warc migration

Hello!
My name is Martin Prokop, I'm a student of informatics at the Masaryk
University in Brno.
I'm working on a bachelor thesis on the topic of ARC to WARC migration.
I think Mr. Coufal mentioned me in one of his e-mails.
I read your information about the migration of your data into WARC from
your correspondence with Mr. Coufal. I'm particularly interested in
migration from ARC format directly into WARC. Do you have any
information or materials concerning this topic, or maybe an experience
with similar conversion?
Best regards,
Martin Prokop
