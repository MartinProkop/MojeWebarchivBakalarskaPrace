Hello, thanks for your reply.

I've already tried to update to the latest version, but the problem
remained.

I'm using: UNIX - Linux 3.2.0-24-generic #38-Ubuntu SMP Tue May 1 16:21:07 UTC
2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux.

I use Python 2.6 and tried Python 2.7.3 too. In both version is the result
invalide.

To verify the warc I use this command in shell: ./warcvalid.py WARC.GZ_NAME

The two ways of running the arc2warc in shell are:
./arc2warc.py -Z -o WARC.GZ_NAME ARC.GZ_NAME
warcvalid error is: [('incorrect trailing newline', '\r')]
./arc2warc.py -Z ARC.GZ_NAME > WARC.GZ_NAME
warcvalid error is: [('incorrect trailing newline', '\n')]

I upload arc.gz archive (100MB). Here is link: http://uloz.to/xvqX1LS/nk-cz-indomain-crawl-2009-01-20091017164608-00002-har-arc-gz
