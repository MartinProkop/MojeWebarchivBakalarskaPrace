Hello, 

During the warctools testing I probably discovered a bug. So I would like
report it. 

Thanks, although without being able to replicate it, I am going to struggle to�
find the bug.


I'm using the version of warctools - Tag: 4.3-rc; Revision: 017110fd860a8;
Date: 2012-03-02.

If you could update to the latest version, and try again - A similar bug was
reported earlier, and could be the cause:

(the fix is http://code.hanzoarchives.com/warc-tools/changeset/3c6b6c16080b )

If this does not work, could you provide a little more information:

What platform are you running warctools under? Which version of python?

UNIX - Linux 3.2.0-24-generic #38-Ubuntu SMP Tue May 1 16:21:07 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

2.6, 2.7.



What command did you run to create the warc, verify the warc? What happened?
You mentioned that it depended on how you ran the programs - what other way
did you run them?

./warcvalid.py ARCHIV: hláška: [('incorrect trailing newline', '\r')] nebo [('incorrect trailing newline', '\n')]


./arc2warc.py -Z -o WARC ARC
./arc2warc.py -Z ARC > WARC



Finally, I will need to inspect the ARC if upgrading does not solve the issue.
If you can arrange for it to be uploaded somewhere,�I can make a copy.�
If this is not possible, I can try to arrange for an ftp server�for you to upload it to.

Hello, thanks for your reply.

I've already tried to update to the latest version, but the problem
remained.

I'm using UNIX - Linux 3.2.0-24-generic #38-Ubuntu SMP Tue May 1 16:21:07 UTC
2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux.

I use Python 2.6.

To verify the warc I use this command: ./warcvalid.py ARCHIVE

The two ways of running the arc2warc are: ./arc2warc.py -Z -o WARC ARC
                                          ./arc2warc.py -Z ARC > WARC
